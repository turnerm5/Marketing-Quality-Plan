# Hoffman Quality Process

## Preconstruction

### Step 1 - Design Kickoff Meeting - "Understand the Vision"

**Goal:**

- Align expectations regarding project scope, individual responsibilities, and commitment to quality.

**Process:**

- Schedule regular drawing review and comment cycles.
- Set clear expectations for what constitutes completeness at each review milestone.
- Integrate insights from the Hoffman Quality Knowledge Repository into the process.
- Foster a collaborative communication culture and team-based approach.

### Step 2 - Drawing Review Process - "Dive Into the Details"

**Goal:**

- Ensure the drawings are complete, constructible, and coordinated  

**Process:**

- Conduct reviews at every document delivery milestone, encompassing both drawings and specifications.
- Organize comment review meetings to discuss feedback.
- Engage dedicated internal experts for detailed reviews.
Prioritize attention on building envelopes and high-risk assembly areas.
- Leverage internal expertise for mechanical, electrical, plumbing (MEP), fire protection (FP), and other specialty reviews.
- Utilize a checklist derived from knowledge acquired from previous projects to ensure thoroughness.
- Implement a system for comment tracking and metrics/reporting to guarantee that the design team is fully aware of the significance of resolving comments and maintaining open communication.

### Step 3 - Transition to Construction - "Ensuring Quality Continuity"

**Goal:**

- Seamlessly transfer knowledge acquired during preconstruction to the construction team.

**Process:**

- Relay critical information about unusual or unique items to the construction team for proactive management.
- Clearly define the scope of work for all subcontracts to ensure clarity and precision.
- Integrate the Quality Activity Plan with the project schedule to maintain alignment.
- Assign roles and responsibilities, ensuring they align with individual expertise, seniority, and available resources; incorporate oversight where necessary.
- Facilitate the transition of any unresolved comments from the documentation phase to the construction site through the Request for Information (RFI) process.

### Preconstruction Quality Tools

To ensure the Hoffman Quality Process is managed effectively, a suite of tools is utilized to enhance communication and foster continuous improvement and accountability.

**Communication:**

- **Project Meetings**: Regularly scheduled to facilitate collaboration and maintain alignment across teams.
- **Bluebeam as a Markup Tool**: A dynamic platform used for document annotation which offers:
  - A shared resource for team access.
  - Capabilities for live updates to documents.
  - Features for comment sorting and tracking to manage feedback efficiently.

**Improvement and Accountability:**

- **Quality Knowledge Repository**: A comprehensive database that catalogues previous challenges and solutions, highlighting high-risk areas and their implications on cost, schedule, and overall project impact.
- **Outside Expertise**: Engagement with industry experts to provide insight and oversight, ensuring adherence to best practices.
- **Metrics and Tracking**: Systematic approach to evaluating quality control measures by:
  - Categorizing quality checks as high, medium, or low priority.
  - Assigning monetary values to potential impacts, facilitating cost-benefit analysis and enabling proactive issue resolution.

## Construction Quality Process

### Step 4 - Preparatory Phase - “Align Our Quality Goals”

**Goal:**

- Synchronize expectations with subcontractors regarding project scope, responsibilities, and dedication to quality standards.

**Process:**

- **Post Award Meeting**: Conduct comprehensive meetings to confirm that all parties understand and agree upon the project scope.
- **Pre-mobilization Meeting**: Arrange discussions prior to on-site work to review the upcoming phases and prepare all teams.
- **Subcontractor-Specific Quality Plans**: Develop detailed quality plans tailored to each subcontractor's scope of work.
- **Quality Personnel Roles**: Define and communicate the roles and expectations for quality management team members to ensure accountability and coverage.

### Step 5 - Preinstallation Phase - “Intentionally Prepare to Build”

**Goal:**

- Strategically plan and communicate project requirements to ensure successful execution.

**Process:**

- **Expert Submittal and Shop Drawing Review**: Ensure all submissions conform to project specifications before installation begins.
- **Test and Inspection Plan**: Develop a comprehensive plan for each subcontractor to follow, guaranteeing quality at every stage.
- **Mockup Planning and Execution**: Implement mockups for each project to:
  - Validate the appearance and integration of components in a three-dimensional context.
  - Conduct trial assemblies to identify and address potential issues before installation.
- **Preinstallation Meetings**: Conduct on-site meetings with installers to review technical details and confirm that the installation will proceed correctly.

### Step 6 - Inspection Phase - “Install and Verify”

**Goal:**

- Verify that the installation adheres to the planned guidelines and quality standards.

**Process:**

- **Materials Verification**: Confirm that all materials meet the project's specifications prior to installation.
- **First Work-in-Place Inspections**: Conduct initial inspections to ensure the first installations are completed correctly.
- **Follow-On Inspections**: Carry out subsequent inspections at intervals determined by the project's scope and associated risks.
- **Hold Points and Special Inspections**: Implement mandatory pause points for quality checks and fulfill all special inspection requirements, such as those mandated by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) and life-safety protocols.
- **Final Inspection**: Perform comprehensive final inspections to validate quality. Note: Hoffman adopts a 'no punchlist' approach as a testament to the efficacy of the ongoing quality process.

### Construction Quality Tools

The Hoffman Quality Process leverages an array of tools during construction designed to support change management, document control, communication, and improvement and accountability across all project phases.

#### Change Management

- RFI (Request for Information) processes and responsive action to changes.
- Management of design changes initiated by the owner or design team.

#### Document Control

- **Procore**: A digital, web-based project management system ensuring real-time access to documentation.
- Maintenance of current documentation throughout the project lifecycle.
- Verification of as-built documentation for completeness and accuracy.

#### Communication

- Regularly scheduled project meetings to maintain project alignment.
- On-site design observations to ensure compliance with the project vision.
- Comprehensive reporting on project progress and management of non-conformances.

#### Improvement and Accountability

- A quality knowledge repository that captures lessons learned and best practices.
- Collaboration with external experts to bolster the project’s quality standards.
- Implementation of metrics and tracking systems to monitor project performance and quality outcomes.
